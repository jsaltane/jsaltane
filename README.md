- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jsaltane. I'm a senior analytical scientist working for big pharma. I completed my MSc in Data Analytics in 2021 and fell in love with this field. I did R, Pythin and SAS as part of my degree.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently looking for a position where I could continue my journey as a data scientist.
- ðŸŒ± I'm finishing off Google Certificate in Data Analytics course, which I started in July 2022.
